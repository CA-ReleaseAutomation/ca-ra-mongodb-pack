1. Sign or be added to an existing [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://communities.ca.com/become-a-contributor).
1. Sign up or login to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
1. Reporting an issue or making a feature request [here](#issues).
1. Adding features or fixing bugs

### <a name="pulls"></a> CA Release Automation Pull Requests

CA Release Automation is enterprise grade software. We strive to ensure high quality throughout the CA Release Automation experience. In order to ensure this, we require a couple of things for all pull requests to CA Release Automation:

**Tests:** To ensure high quality code and protect against future regressions, we require all the
  code in CA Release Automation to have at least unit test coverage. See the [spec/unit](https://communities.ca.com/testing)

In addition to this it would be nice to include the description of the problem you are solving
  with your change. You can use [CA Release Automation Issue Template](#issuetemplate) in the description section
  of the pull request.

### <a name="cr"></a> CA Release Automation Code Review Process

The CA Release Automation Code Review process happens on Github pull requests. See
  [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) if you're not
  familiar with Github Pull Requests.

Once you a pull request, the **CA Release Automation Engineering Team** or **CA Release Automation Core Committers** will review your code and respond to you with any feedback they might have. The process at this point is as follows:

1. 2 thumbs-ups are required from the **CA Release Automation Engineering Team** or **CA Release Automation Core Committers** for all merges.
1. When ready, your pull request will be tagged with label `Ready For Merge`.
1. Your patch will be merged into `master` including necessary documentation updates
  and you will be included in `CHANGELOG.md`. Our goal is to have patches merged in 4 weeks
  after they are marked to be merged.

### <a name="oh"></a> Developer Office Hours

We hold regular "office hours" on CA Communities that you can join to review contributions together,
ask questions about contributing, or just hang out with CA Release Automation Software employees.  The regularly scheduled CA Release Automation hangouts occur on Mondays and Wednesdays at 3pm Eastern / Noon Pacific.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
Licensing is very important to open source projects. It helps ensure the
  software continues to be available under the terms that the author desired.

CA Release Automation uses [the Eclipse 1.0 license](https://www.github.com/ca-releaseautomation/LICENSE)
  to strike a balance between open contribution and allowing you to use the
  software however you would like to.

The license tells you what rights you have that are provided by the copyright holder.
  It is important that the contributor fully understands what rights they are
  licensing and agrees to them. Sometimes the copyright holder isn't the contributor,
  most often when the contributor is doing work for a company.

To make a good faith effort to ensure these criteria are met, CA Release Automation requires an Conributor License Agreement (CLA)
  for contributions. This agreement helps ensure you are aware of the
  terms of the license you are contributing your copyrighted works under, which helps to
  prevent the inclusion of works in the projects that the contributor does not hold the rights
  to share.

It only takes a few minutes to complete a CLA.

You can complete our:
  [CLA](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/CA-ReleaseAutomation/ca-ra-nginx-pack) online.
  
### CA Release Automation Obvious Fix Policy

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough
  to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch,
  without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality
  or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely
  examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

**Whenever you invoke the “obvious fix” rule, please say so in your commit message:**

```
